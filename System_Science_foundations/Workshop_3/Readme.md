# Workshop 3 â€” Machine Learning & Cybernetics: Autonomous Adaptive Agent

This repository contains the implementation for **Workshop 3** of the Systems Sciences course (Semester 2025-I) at **Universidad Distrital Francisco JosÃ© de Caldas**, under the guidance of **Eng. Carlos AndrÃ©s Sierra, M.Sc.**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this workshop, we extend the design and dynamic system foundations from Workshops 1 and 2 by integrating **machine learning (DQN)** and **cybernetic feedback control** into a simulation of an autonomous drone. The drone operates in a simulated city environment, using sensor-driven feedback loops to adapt its behavior and avoid obstacles (including random dynamic elements such as a bird).

Key features:
- Reinforcement learning via **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**.
- Cybernetic control through real-time feedback loops based on local 3Ã—3 grid sensing.
- Reward functions aligned with navigation goals and collision avoidance.
