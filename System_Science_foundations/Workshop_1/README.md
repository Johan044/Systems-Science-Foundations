# Workshop 1 – Systems Design: Autonomous Adaptive Agent

This folder contains the deliverables for **Workshop No. 1** of the course *Systems Sciences Introduction (2025-I)* at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas. The workshop focuses on designing a cybernetic system for a drone-based agent capable of learning and adapting in a simulated environment.

## Contents

- `System_Design_Workshop1_Johan_Gutierrez.pdf`: Full design document including:
  - Functional specifications
  - Use case overview
  - High-level architecture
  - Feedback loop design
  - Frameworks and tools
  - Development timeline

## Summary

The project proposes the architecture and learning path for a drone that navigates a simulated city using reinforcement learning and cybernetic principles. The environment is developed using **Gymnasium**, and the learning is implemented with **Stable-Baselines3**, transitioning from **Q-learning** to **DQN**. Feedback loops, sensors, and reward functions are included to support adaptive behavior.
